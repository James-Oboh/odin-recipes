# Odin Recipes Project

## What I Learned

In this section of the project, I learned the basics of structuring an HTML project, including:

- Creating multiple HTML files for different recipes and organizing them in a `recipes` directory.
- Using semantic HTML elements such as `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<img>` to build clear and accessible web pages.
- Linking between pages using relative paths, allowing easy navigation from the main index to individual recipes and back.
- Structuring content with headings, descriptions, ingredient lists, and step-by-step instructions.
- Managing images and referencing them correctly in HTML.

This project helped me understand the foundational concepts of web development and how to organize a simple static website. I plan to build on this knowledge as I continue to improve and expand the project.
